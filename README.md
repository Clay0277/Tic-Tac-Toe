This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js. It allows players to take turns and play against an advanced AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

Play against an AI opponent with intelligent moves using the Minimax algorithm.
Interactive game board: Click on the cells to make moves.
Game status display: Shows the winner, current player's turn, or if the game ended in a draw.

### Installation

### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git

### Navigate to the project directory:

cd tic-tac-toe

### Install the dependencies:

npm install

### Start the development server:

npm start

### Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to play the game.

## How to Play

Play against the AI opponent. You (X) will take the first turn, and the AI (O) will make intelligent moves in its turn.

## Make your move

Click on an empty cell to make your move, and the AI will respond with its move automatically.

### Winning:

If a player forms a line of three marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win the game.
If all cells are filled, and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
Restarting the Game:

To restart the game at any point, simply refresh the page, and the board will be reset.
