# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js. It allows two players to take turns and play against each other, and also includes a single-player mode with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

Play against an AI opponent with intelligent moves using the Minimax algorithm.
Interactive game board: Click on the cells to make moves.
Game status display: Shows the winner, current player's turn, or if the game ended in a draw.
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd tic-tac-toe
Install the dependencies:

npm install
Start the development server:

npm start
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to play the game.

## How to Play

Play against the AI opponent. You (X) will take the first turn, and the AI (O) will make intelligent moves in its turn.

# Make your move:

Click on an empty cell to make your move, and the AI will respond with its move automatically.
Winning:

If a player forms a line of three marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win the game.
If all cells are filled, and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
Restarting the Game:

To restart the game at any point, simply refresh the page, and the board will be reset.
